           Searching is the most common operations performed in an array
           Arrays Searching is search of a particular element or group of an element in an array
           There are several algorithms.Most commonly used algorithms are
           1.Linear search
           2.Binary Search
           3.Ternary Search

           Linear Search: sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired(target or required)element or group of elements is found.
           Time Complexity: O(N) // here N is a Length of the array.

           Binary Search: Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array. In this algorithm, the element is found by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and deciding the next interval to find the element.
           The only thing to note is that the array must be sorted in increasing or decreasing order.
           Time Complexity: O(Log2N).

           Ternary Search: Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that can be used to find an element in an array.
           it is similar to binary search.We divide the array in to three parts and find the target or desired element.
           The only thing to note is tha the array must be sorted in increasing or decreasing order.
           Time complexity: O(Log3N).
